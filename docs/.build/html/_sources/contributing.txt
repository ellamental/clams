Contributing
============

Eventually I'll add some instructions and more information about contributing.
In the meantime, if you want to get involved just send an email to
nick@unb.services, a pull-request to
`github <https://github.com/unbservices/clams>`_, or add an issue to
`our tracker <https://github.com/unbservices/clams/issues>`_.


Development Tools
-----------------

Clams uses `unb-cli <https://bitbucket.org/unbsolutions/unb-cli>`_ to simplify
and standardize common development and project management tasks.

Unfortunately, `unb-cli <https://bitbucket.org/unbsolutions/unb-cli>`_ is not
(yet) available as an open source package.


Docs for the Docs
-----------------

Documentation is managed by `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_.

Documentation is built using ``unb-cli build sphinx``.
