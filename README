Clams
=====

Create simple, nested, command-line interfaces with Clams (Command Line
Applications Made Simple).


Installation
------------

    pip install clams --extra-index-url https://repo.fury.io/nickzarr/


Example
-------

A simple example with one `hello` sub-command.  This can be found at
[/demo/salutation.py](/demo/salutation.py).

    from clams import arg, Command


    root = Command('salutation')


    @root.register('hello')
    @arg('name', nargs='?')  # <== same interface as argparse's `add_argument`
    def handler(name):
        print 'Hello %s' % name or 'Nick'


    @root.register('goodbye')
    @arg('name', nargs='?')
    def handler(name):
        print 'Goodbye %s' % name or 'Nick'


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        root.init()
        root.parse_args()


Usage:

    $ cd demo

    $ ./salutation.py hello
    Hello Nick

    $ ./salutation.py hello Jason
    Hello Jason

    $ ./salutation.py goodbye "my friend."
    Goodbye my friend.
